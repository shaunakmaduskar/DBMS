Conceptual model : 
  Some attributes that are common to many entities have multiple lines .(Web Tool Constraint)
  Composite attributes are in green
  Primary keys are in yellow
  Degrees of entities :
  Classes - 11
  Enrollment - 6
  Staff - 7
  Students - 10
  Pool - 3
  Levels - 2
  
  
  Weak entity found - Enrollment 
  Changes made - added ID attribute as new primary key
  Highlighted in green
  
  Redundancy detected in Students and Staff as both entities have repeated attributes 
  Proposed solution - Use a generalised entity to cover both students and staff with a discriminant atrribute
  Highlighted in yellow
